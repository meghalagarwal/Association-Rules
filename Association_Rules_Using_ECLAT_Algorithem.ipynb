    "The first step is to make a list that contains, for each product, a list of the Transaction IDs in which the product occurs. This list is represented in the following table.\n",

    "\n",
    "These transaction ID lists are is called the Transaction ID Set, also called TID set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2 — Filter with minimum support\n",
    "The next step is to decide on a value called the minimum support. The minimum support will serve to filter out products that do not occur often enough to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current example, we will choose a value of 7 for the minimum support. As you can see in the table of Step 1, there are two products that have a TID set that contains less than 7 transactions: Flour and Butter. Therefore, we will filter them out, and we obtain the following table:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 3 — Compute the Transaction ID set of each product pair\n",
    "We now move on to pairs of products. We will basically repeat the same thing as in step 1, but now for product pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interesting thing about the ECLAT algorithm is that this step is done using the Intersection of the two original sets. This makes it different from the Apriori algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECLAT algorithm is faster because it is much simpler to identify the intersection of the set of transactions IDs than to scan each individual transaction for the presence of pairs of products (as Apriori does). You can see in the below image how it's easy to filter out the transaction IDs that are common between the product pair Wine and Cheese:\n",

    "The ECLAT Algorithm. Finding the intersection of Transactions IDs is easier than scanning the whole database\n",

    "The Transaction ID sets for all product pairs that are still in the race.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4 — Filter out the pairs that do not reach minimum support\n",
    "As before, we need to filter out results that do not reach the minimum support of 7. This leaves us with only two remaining product pairs: Wine & Cheese and Beer & Potato Chips.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 5— Continue as long as you can make new pairs above support\n",
    "From this point on, you repeat the steps as long as possible. For the current example, if we create the product pairs of three products, you’ll find that there aren’t any groups of three that reach the minimum support level. Therefore, the association rules will be those obtained in the previous step."

People also often buy Potato Chips and Beer together. Clearly, it could be a good idea to put those products together so that people can easily get to both of them."
